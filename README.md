# Stock Analysis with VBA

## Overview of the Project

The purpose of this analysis was to display tickers, volumes, and yearly returns for different green stocks in the years 2017 and 2018, so Steve can help improve his parents' investments into green energy. After successfully providing Steve with analyses about the stocks, we also improved the efficiency of the macros to make them smoother, faster, and readily available for future use. 

## Results
### Analysis

For this analysis, I reused some old code that was previously a part of the original stock analysis to make the refactored analysis better. I created variables and arrays that I used to "scan" through the various different stocks and extract useful information like the ticker symbol, volumes, and annual returns. I then reused the old output code,  changing the values to the correct, refactored variables and arrays, to show Steve important information about green stocks. Below is the script used for the analysis:

## Summary

## Refactoring Code in General
### Advantages

The advantages of refactoring code are that our code looks much cleaner and more ogranized so it's readily available to be viewed by other programmers. Overall, having this better code allows for the user's computer to excute the commands faster, in turn, improving their experience, supporting their computer's health, and allowing for analyses to be done much quicker. 

### Disadvantages

While these are great advantages to refactoring, sometimes there are disadvantages. Some of these disadvantages include problems with debugging, inconsistencies with formatting, and risk of changing the code to the point where you have trouble fixing it again, which all degrade the user experience and efficeincy. 

## Refactoring VBA Script
### Advantages

The biggest advantage of refactoring the original script was that the analysis was able to run almost 4-5 times faster. The original time that it took to run the macro was a little over 1 second, showing that refactoring the original code made the analysis more efficient and more usable.

### Disadvantages

The biggest disadvantage of refactoring the original script was that it was time consuming. We already had a working macro that displayed what we wanted it to and helped Steve with his investments. While it ran slower than the refactored macro, it was already created and ready to use.
